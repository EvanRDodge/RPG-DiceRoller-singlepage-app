# RPG-DiceRoller-singlepage-app
This is a single-page web application that generates results for role playing game dice rolls as well as die roll expressions. This html file features buttons for rolling standard rpg dice (4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided) as  well as three areas for more complex die roll expressions, such as 2*(1d6+1)+2, to be entered and rolled. The die roll expressions are white-space insensitive and support only numerical, basic math operators (+,-,*,/), parentheses, and the die roll operator XdY, which translates to sum up the rolls for X number of Y-sided dice (uppercase d also works). Note: Expressions will not evaluate if there if it cannot be done so mathematically or if they contain characters other than those previously stated.
